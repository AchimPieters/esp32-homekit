# ESP32 HomeKit Development with IDF

## Overview
This repository provides a step-by-step guide to developing HomeKit accessories using ESP32 and the ESP-IDF framework.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the necessary software installed before proceeding:

### 1. Setup Development Environment
#### Docker
- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Mac.
- Sign in to your Docker account.
- Pull the latest ESP-IDF version:
  ```sh
  docker pull espressif/idf:v5.3
  ```

#### Python Installation
Check if Python 3 is installed:
```sh
python3 --version
```
If not installed:
```sh
xcode-select --install  # Install Xcode
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"  # Install Homebrew
brew install python3  # Install Python 3
```

#### PIP Installation
```sh
python3 -m ensurepip
```

#### ESP Tool Installation
Ensure Python 3.10.1 or newer is installed, then run:
```sh
pip3 install esptool
```

## Getting Started with ESP32 HomeKit - LED

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/AchimPieters/esp32-homekit-demo.git
```

### 2. Set Up Docker Environment
```sh
docker run -it -v ~/esp32-homekit-demo:/project -w /project espressif/idf:v5.3
```

### 3. Configuration
```sh
cd examples/led
idf.py set-target esp32
idf.py menuconfig
```
Configure Wi-Fi credentials under `StudioPieters`:
- Wi-Fi SSID: `(mysid)`
- Wi-Fi Password: `(mypassword)`

Save and exit.

### 4. Build and Flash ESP32
```sh
idf.py build
esptool.py erase_flash
python -m esptool --chip esp32 -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash \
--flash_mode dio --flash_size 4MB --flash_freq 40m \
0x1000 build/bootloader/bootloader.bin \
0x8000 build/partition_table/partition-table.bin \
0x10000 build/main.bin
```

### 5. View Serial Output
```sh
screen /dev/tty.usbserial-01FD1166 115200
```
Replace `/dev/tty.usbserial-01FD1166` with your USB port.

## Connecting ESP32 to HomeKit

### 1. Open HomeKit App
Launch your HomeKit app on your smartphone.

### 2. Scan QR Code
Scan the generated QR code to add your ESP32 device.

### 3. Add Device
Accept the uncertified accessory prompt and add the device.

### 4. Control the LED
Toggle the LED on/off directly from the HomeKit app.

### 5. Customize Automations (Optional)
Set up HomeKit automations for advanced functionality.

---

## Generating a QR Code for ESP32 HomeKit
### Setup Code
The HomeKit setup code must be an 8-digit number, formatted as `XXX-XX-XXX` (e.g., `101-48-005`).

### Setup ID
Each accessory needs a unique 4-character setup ID (e.g., `1QJ8`).

```c
homekit_server_config_t config = {
     .accessories = accessories,
     .password = "123-45-678",
     .setupId = "1QJ8",
};
```

### Generate the QR Code
Ensure Python and required libraries are installed:
```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip Pillow qrcode
```
Generate the QR code:
```sh
tools/gen_qrcode 5 123-45-678 1QJ8 qrcode.png
```


- `5`: HomeKit accessory category (Lighting)
- `123-45-678`: Setup code
- `1QJ8`: Setup ID
- `qrcode.png`: Output file

###### WORKS WITH APPLE HOME BADGE
<sub>The Works with Apple Home badge can be used to visually communicate that your accessory is compatible with the Apple Home and Siri on Apple devices. If you plan to develop or manufacture a HomeKit accessory that will be distributed or sold, your company needs to be enrolled in the MFi Program.</sub>

###### APPLE HOME
<sub>HomeKit Accessory Protocol (HAP) is Apple’s proprietary protocol that enables third-party accessories in the home (e.g., lights, thermostats and door locks) and Apple products to communicate with each other. HAP supports two transports, IP and Bluetooth LE. The information provided in the HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification (Non-Commercial Version) describes how to implement HAP in an accessory that you create for non-commercial use and that will not be distributed or sold.</sub>

<sub>The HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification (Non-Commercial Version) can be downloaded from the HomeKit Apple Developer page.</sub>
