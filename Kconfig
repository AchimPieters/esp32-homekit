config HOMEKIT_MAX_CLIENTS
    int "Maximum number of simultaneous clients"
    default 16
    help
        Maximum number of simultaneous clients allowed. New connections above this
        limit will be rejected. Each connection requires ~1100-1200 bytes of RAM

config HOMEKIT_SMALL
    bool "Minimize firmware size"
    default n
    help
        Configures components to use smaller (but slower) implementations. Helps
        decrease firmware size ~70KB at cost of increasing pair verify time

config HOMEKIT_DEBUG
    bool "Debug output"
    default n
    help
        Enable debug output to serial console

config HOMEKIT_MDNS_PROTOCOL_VERSION
    string "HAP mDNS protocol version (pv TXT record)"
    default "1.1"
    help
        Value advertised in mDNS TXT key 'pv'. For HAP-over-IP this is typically
        "1.1". Override only when explicitly targeting a different protocol profile.

config HOMEKIT_MDNS_FEATURE_FLAGS
    int "HAP mDNS feature flags (ff TXT record)"
    range 0 255
    default 0
    help
        Value advertised in mDNS TXT key 'ff'. Keep at 0 unless your product
        profile requires specific feature-flag bits.

config HOMEKIT_SETUP_PAYLOAD_FLAGS
    int "HomeKit setup payload transport flags"
    range 0 15
    default 2
    help
        4-bit value used in setup payload generation. Default 2 targets IP.

config HOMEKIT_MDNS_ENABLE_IPV6
    bool "Enable IPv6 in built-in mDNS implementation"
    default n
    help
        Enables AAAA records and IPv6 sockets in the built-in mDNS stack.
        Enable this when your target deployment requires dual-stack operation.
